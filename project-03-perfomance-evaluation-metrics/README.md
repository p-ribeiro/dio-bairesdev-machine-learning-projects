# Performance Evaluation Metrics

This is a simple project in python for the course of __Statistical Learning Theory__ from [__Dio__](https://web.dio.me)

In this project I read from a confusion matrix generated from an Image Classification Model and calculate the True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), True Negative (TN) and False Negative (FN) values for each label.
