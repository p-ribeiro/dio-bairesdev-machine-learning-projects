# Dimensionality Reduction Project

This is a simple project in python for the course of __Machine Learning Training Algorithms__ from [__Dio__](https://web.dio.me)

In this project I reduce the dimensions of a sample image by transforming it to an image in _shades of gray_ and in _binary black and white_.

I used the __Pillow__ library to complete this assignment
